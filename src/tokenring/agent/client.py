class BackgroundTokenRing(KeyringBackend):
    """
    Keyring backend that connects to a L{tokenring.local.LocalTokenRing}
    running in a dedicated helper process, for two reasons:

        1. to minimize the amount of code running in the UAC-elevated process
           until we address the issue described in L{tokenring._admin_pipe}

        2. to reduce the number of user-presence checks when repeated
           authentications are require.  Specifically, the vault itself needs a
           UP/PIN check for unlock, but then, each credential will also need a
           UP check.  With a background helper, you can unlock the vault for a
           session and only touch the key once for each credential rather than
           twice.
